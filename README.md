# Super_Vapor_Rush

>Game Development Project for CSC 4821

Introducing Super Vapor Rush, a space race synth-wave based game that will be a single-player experience. The layout of the game will be in the form of a time attack with the objective being to get from the starting point to the finish line within the allotted time. Players will have to dodge incoming objects and traps in order to get to the finish line in time. It is important to note that the objective is subject to change depending on what we feel is more feasible down the line. In order to avoid confusion pertaining to any intricate detail, a bio will be provided within the game so that the player understands all the traps and objects that will be challenging them. The game overall will have an overall neon aesthetic that will be set in space with relevant music to go along with the theme.
